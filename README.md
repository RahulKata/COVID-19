# COVID-19

### Symptom Checker using flask

- This is a very minimal flask app to predict COVID-19 risk chances
- Dataset used is completely fictitious as I couldn't find any symptom based dataset
- The website preview is attached below

> Make sure you have flask installed, then open symptom_checker dir and **`python main.py`**

- Inspired by <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/03/16/detecting-covid-19-in-x-ray-images-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/">Adrian Rosebrock</a>
- The model metrics are showed below (x - indicates EarlyStopping).
